This folder was created to make easier the finding of my scripts used
for the paper on potential predictability of SST around Australia

The scripts in this folder are copied from my backed up files and are 
the version used for the paper. 

Below is the list of the scripts


to replot fig1: in band variance
calc_InBand_Variance.py

potential pred ratio: plot_PotPred.py

EOF maps: 
plot_eof_EigvalEigvec.py with eigvect_daily_1deg_NoWeight.nc and 2 other files


PC and RCs:
calc_ssa_pcs.m

correlation maps:
calc_ssa_pcs.m

schematics done with inkscape
